## Install in prod

Make sure you have python 3.7+ (with venv):

```bash
python3.7 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
git clone git@github.com:ksamuel/matching.git matching
cd matching
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a "matching" user, e.g (with admin privileges):

```bash
useradd matching
```

Make sure your init system runs this:

```
/path/to/the/project/env/bin/gunicorn project.wsgi -b 0.0.0.0:8000  --workers 4
```

At boot. It should also pass the following environment variables:

- INSERJEUNES_DB_PWD: put here the database password that has been removed from the XML
- REDIS_URL: put here the url to connect to the redis instance
- DEBUG: this should be false in production
- SECRET_KEY: put here a randomly generated secret key used for session management

Example values for env vars:

```init
INSERJEUNES_DB_PWD=fj789hfdsUB6FFd
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0
SECRET_KEY=#2t!6-q@)!lxa@bupm%4*e5bn-1q&$rwg#+q&9o!o4mormm=-b
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 SECRET_KEY="%2bz%!
DEBUG=false
```

Use a new secret key for each prod, generate one from https://djecrety.ir/ but remove any "%" since systemd interprets
them.

Start the service, and ensure your web server is doing a proxy pass to `0.0.0.0:8000`, and set the root directory to "
/path/to/the/project/frontend/dist".


## Setup dev

Make sure you have python 3.7+ (with venv), and run the backend:

```bash
python3.7 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
git clone git@github.com:ksamuel/matching.git matching
cd matching
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```

Make sure you have nodejs 12+, and in another terminal run the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install --include=dev
npm run dev
```

To build the project:

```bash
npm run build # outputs in frontend/dist
```
